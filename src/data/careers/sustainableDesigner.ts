  careerOutlook: "The demand for Sustainable Designers is growing rapidly as organizations face increasing pressure from consumers, regulations, and climate change impacts to address environmental challenges. Companies across sectors from consumer goods to architecture are establishing sustainability teams and integrating eco-design principles into their development processes. The rise of circular economy initiatives, extended producer responsibility legislation, and carbon reduction commitments further drives demand. Designers who can balance environmental considerations with compelling user experiences and business viability will be particularly valuable in this evolving field."
